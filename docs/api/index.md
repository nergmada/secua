# Secua Library

Secua has the following sub tables
```lua
secua.aes
secua.utils
```

## secua.aes
[`secua.aes`](/secua/api/aes) contains the necessary functions to encrypt and decrypt binary data
according to the AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256 Symmetric Encryption Standard.

For more information on it, please see [the main AES page](/secua/api/aes).

## secua.utils
`secua.utils` contains helper functions which don't fit directly into other
libraries. It can be thought of as the screws, allen(?) keys and other handy tools
necessary to make everything else work.

For more information on it, please see the main utils page.
